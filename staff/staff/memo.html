<p>From: Olestine, Barbra Jo</p>
<p>To: All</p>
<p>Concerning: Station Head</p>
<p>  As you all may know, my husband is the head of the station</p>
<p>He has passed recently and we are unsure of if we can stay with PBS</p>
<p>We have an offer from the MyNetworkTV company. They will allow us to keep our name</p>
<p>Becoming a part of this company will cut down on our ability to show local programing</p>
<p>Please respond ASAP</p>
<p>This will be posted on the wall of the UNIX system</p>
